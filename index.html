  <h3>Project and Training</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>MAJOR TRAINING – </b>“ BHARAT HEAVY ELECTRICALS LIMITED ” at Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh (June,2019)<br>
<b>Project:</b> A study on Manufacturing Process and Hydroelectric Power Plant <br>
<b>Duration:</b> 2 month (June-August 2019)<br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Summer training at BHEL-Bhopal had been an invaluable and enriching experience. During this training I have learnt to apply theoretical concepts in practical field. There, I was able to learn numerous manufacturing processes and as part of project I wrote a report on a brief overview of the Hydro Generator, its components and its sub-assemblies.</li>
    <li><b>MAJOR PROJECT -</b> “ENHANCED PERFORMANCE OF EVAPORATIVE BASED AIR COOLING” (JULY, 2020), and got my research paper published on it.<br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> It was a team work in which our main focus is on energy savings and less use of fossil fuels. In our society conventional vapors compression air conditioning is dominant over evaporative cooling which produces harmful effect to our environment and consumes very high amount of energy, to overcome this we are focusing towards improving the efficiency of evaporative cooler which is environmental friendly and less energy consumptions.
The performance of evaporative cooling is enhanced by pre-cooling of air with desiccant or with membrane and can be used as both for effective cooling and dehumidification of air, and one more research is going on the evaporative cooler in which after the cooling of air the water which helps in cooling can be used as the drinking water and the end of the day. So the future of world is totally towards the replacement of modern VCRS system with evaporative cooling.</li>
